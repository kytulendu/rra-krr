Author Note: This is just my take in isekai (also known as “transport to other world”) genre, as I’d like to write a silly story for the fun and as an experiment. I have not much experience in writing story, as a result, this story will badly written, so bear with me :P

This story is kinda a fanfiction style of my own character’s story, set in fantasy with science fiction element universe. As the usual of the story in this genre, the main character somehow got transported the other world, and doing some adventures while not getting killed.

Yeah, I suck at summary...

### Prologue

Some where on the unfamiliar world, where magic exist. It was night time. Above a small mountain in The Thornroot Forest the two moons of this world shire brightly in the sky. On that small mountain, there is an area with ancient ruin structure that build on top of layline, the ruin area filled with potent mana flow. It structure was of stacked-rock structure that arrange in circle, just like Stonehenge that we known of.

In the center was a cube shape large rock the size of large bed, it’s surface was smooth unlike the stone around it. The cube was leaking mana, which confirmed that it was a construct of magical nature. The purpose of this ruin was for perform powerful magic ritual.

There was a group of robed figure gather in circle around a stone, with one who was leader of the group in the center front of the stone bed. The group are from various races of this world, there are some elf, dwarf and even a few humans in the mix as well, but most of them are from beastfolk, such are wolffolk, dogfolk, lizardfolk, catfolk, foxfolk, tigerfolk, etc.

On the stone bed was littered with rare animal and monster carcass, composed of various raw meats, bones, and various rare herbs and woods scatter around. The leader of the group, who was a member of a race called werewolf, who able to change their form to human or wolf or something between, leading the group to chanting in the sacred language of hissing and growling tongue.

Behind the tree line around this ancient stone circle, there was the inquisitors from The Holy Empire hidden in the shadow behind tree line, they who have heard of a rumor of a group of heretic who attempt to summon a Demon Lord in The Thornroot Forest, and that rumor was true. This night, those heretic will die!

The robed figure leader chanting, while using his claw to draw elaborate pattern with blood on a sabertooth tiger skull that was among the offering on the stone bed. Suddenly, a large red colored magic circle appear around the ancient ruin, along with the red glow of runic script in dot and comas decorate on the stone bed.

With out warning, arrows, crossbow bolts and magic bolts was raining from around the tree line, a cry of pain was heard from the unfortunate, followed by another after another.

The robed group quickly form defensive circle, some using nearby stone pillars for cover, while some other who was a mage quickly cast sheild spell to deflect the attack or retaliate.

"Chaaarrrge!!!" A warcry was heard from all around, as the inquisitors have outnumbered the robed group 3 to 1, they no change of wining and the following was one sided slaughter.

The werewolf leader laying near the stone bed, his body is full of wounds and was bleeding heavly. He see his follower get finished off one by one. Strangly, the ritual is still continuing, even there are no one chanting the spell. ... the inquisitors leader going to finish off

With no one survived or escaped, the inquisitor have scucessfully stopped the summoning ritual. They destroying the ancient stone structure.  But there was something strange, The inquisitors have finished their business and leave the scene, without notice the soft glow of red dot-comas on the intact stone bed...
